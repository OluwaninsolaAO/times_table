# Times Table
This is a simple repo that contains multiplication tables of 12 steps 
from Table of 1 to x, x is not determined as this repo will be 
automated using bash script.

> The script run on loop/iteraation wise. Every iteration creates
> a text file with ".txt" file extension, and the content of the
> file is simple shown   for example below: Table 1
> * 1 x 1 = 1
> * 1 x 2 = 2
> * 1 x 3 = 3
> * 1 x 4 = 4
> * 1 x 5 = 5
> * 1 x 6 = 6
> * 1 x 7 = 7
> * 1 x 8 = 8
> * 1 x 9 = 9
> * 1 x 10 = 10
> * 1 x 11 = 11
> * 1 x 12 = 12
>
> Resulting files is organized in folders by the script to avoid
> things getting  crazy quickly. :D

## For a start ```run.sh```
Clone this repository or copy the script to your machine, create your
repository, copy the script to the root of your repository and run
the script with:
```$ ./run.sh```

If all  is done correctly, your script should start running in no

This means the script will run continuosly except when error is
encountered due to network or git not pushing to remote repository.
